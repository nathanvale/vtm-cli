---

## The Three Paths Forward

### Path 1: Use It (Recommended First) üöÄ

**Why this first:** Prove the system works before adding more features.

**What to do:**

1. Pick a real feature you want to build
2. Write an ADR documenting your architectural decision
3. Write a Spec breaking down the implementation
4. Run `/plan:to-vtm adr/YOUR-ADR.md specs/YOUR-SPEC.md`
5. Review the generated tasks
6. Implement them using the VTM workflow
7. Document what worked and what didn't

**Expected timeline:** 1-2 weeks of real usage

**Success criteria:**

- ‚úÖ Can create real tasks from real documents
- ‚úÖ Tasks are accurate and complete
- ‚úÖ Workflow feels natural
- ‚úÖ System saves significant time

**Deliverables:**

- Real-world usage examples
- Feedback document
- List of pain points
- Ideas for improvements

---

### Path 2: Enhance Based on Feedback

**When:** After 1-2 weeks of real usage (Path 1)

**Potential enhancements based on common pain points:**

#### 2.1: Rich Context Extraction (If Traceability Needed)

**Problem:** Tasks lack detailed context from source documents

**Solution:** Enhance agent prompt to extract:

- Exact ADR sections with line numbers
- Spec sections with code examples
- Rationale and constraints
- Related decisions

**Effort:** 1-2 days
**Value:** High if you need full traceability

#### 2.2: Dependency Visualization (If Complex Dependencies)

**Problem:** Hard to understand task relationships in text

**Solution:** Generate visual dependency graphs

```bash
vtm graph              # ASCII dependency tree
vtm graph --mermaid    # Mermaid diagram for GitHub
vtm graph --dot        # Graphviz DOT format
```

**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Value:** High for complex projects

#### 2.3: Task Templates (If Repetitive Patterns)

**Problem:** Same types of tasks repeatedly

**Solution:** Template system

```bash
vtm template list                    # Show available templates
vtm template apply api-endpoint      # Apply template
vtm template create my-pattern       # Save as template
```

**Effort:** 3-4 days
**Value:** Medium-High for standardized workflows

#### 2.4: Batch Operations (If Managing Many Tasks)

**Problem:** Need to update multiple tasks at once

**Solution:** Batch commands

```bash
vtm batch start --tag=frontend      # Start all frontend tasks
vtm batch complete --sprint=1       # Complete all sprint 1 tasks
vtm batch update --status=blocked   # Bulk status updates
```

**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Value:** Medium for large projects

#### 2.5: Integration with External Tools

**Problem:** Need to sync with other systems

**Solutions:**

**GitHub Integration:**

```bash
vtm sync github --create-issues     # Create GitHub issues from tasks
vtm sync github --import-issues     # Import issues to VTM
vtm sync github --link TASK-001     # Link task to issue #42
```

**Effort:** 1 week
**Value:** High for teams using GitHub

**Linear/Jira Integration:**

```bash
vtm export linear     # Export to Linear format
vtm export jira       # Export to Jira format
```

**Effort:** 1 week per integration
**Value:** High for teams using these tools

#### 2.6: Time Tracking and Analytics

**Problem:** Want to measure actual vs estimated time

**Solution:** Enhanced tracking

```bash
vtm track start TASK-001             # Start timer
vtm track stop TASK-001              # Stop timer
vtm track report --week              # Weekly report
vtm analytics                        # Velocity, accuracy metrics
```

**Effort:** 1 week
**Value:** Medium-High for process improvement

#### 2.7: Multi-VTM Support (If Managing Multiple Projects)

**Problem:** Switching between different projects

**Solution:** Project management

```bash
vtm project list                     # List all projects
vtm project switch my-api            # Switch active project
vtm project create new-project       # Create new VTM
```

**Effort:** 3-4 days
**Value:** High for multi-project developers

---

### Path 3: Package and Share

**When:** After validation through real usage (Paths 1 & 2)

**What to build:**

#### 3.1: npm Package (Public Release)

**Goal:** Make VTM CLI installable via npm

**Steps:**

1. Prepare package.json for publishing
2. Add installation docs
3. Create examples directory
4. Write contributing guide
5. Publish to npm registry

```bash
# Users can then install with:
npm install -g vtm-cli

# Or use with npx:
npx vtm-cli next
```

**Effort:** 1-2 days
**Value:** High for adoption

#### 3.2: Claude Code Plugin (Distribution)

**Goal:** Package as Claude Code plugin for easy installation

**Deliverables:**

- Plugin manifest
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Video walkthrough

**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Value:** High for Claude Code users

#### 3.3: Documentation Site

**Goal:** Comprehensive documentation and examples

**Sections:**

- Getting Started guide
- Tutorial: First feature end-to-end
- Command reference
- Best practices
- Architecture overview
- Contributing guide

**Effort:** 1 week
**Value:** High for onboarding

#### 3.4: Example Projects

**Goal:** Real-world examples showing VTM in action

**Examples:**

- REST API implementation
- CLI tool development
- React component library
- Database migration system

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks total
**Value:** High for understanding

## Priority Matrix: What to Build When

### Build FIRST (High Impact, Real Need):

- ‚úÖ Whatever caused you pain in Weeks 1-2
- ‚úÖ Features you wished existed during real usage
- ‚úÖ Enhancements that save significant time

### Build LATER (Nice-to-Have):

- Features that sound cool but aren't painful yet
- Integrations you don't actively use
- Analytics you won't look at

### DON'T Build:

- Features that solve hypothetical problems
- Tools that duplicate existing solutions
- Complexity for complexity's sake

---

## Concrete Next Actions

### This Week:

**Day 1: Choose a Real Feature**

- Pick something you actually need to build
- Could be VTM CLI enhancement
- Could be separate project
- Write it down

**Day 2: Document with ADR + Spec**

- Write ADR explaining architectural decision
- Write Spec breaking down implementation
- Use your own system's examples as reference

**Day 3: Run Plan-to-VTM**

```bash
/plan:to-vtm adr/YOUR-ADR.md specs/YOUR-SPEC.md
```

- Review generated tasks
- Note any issues
- Document experience

**Day 4-7: Implement Using VTM**

```bash
vtm next                    # Get ready tasks
vtm context TASK-XXX        # Get context
# ‚Üí Implement with Claude Code
vtm complete TASK-XXX       # Mark done
vtm stats                   # Check progress
```

**End of Week: Reflection**

- What worked well?
- What was frustrating?
- What features would have helped?
- What didn't work as expected?

---

### Next Week:

**Based on Week 1 feedback, build 1-2 enhancements from Path 2**

---

## What NOT to Do

### ‚ùå Don't: Build More Features Before Using What Exists

**Why:** You'll build the wrong things

**Instead:** Use it first, then enhance based on real pain

### ‚ùå Don't: Try to Support Every Possible Use Case

**Why:** You'll build bloated, complex software

**Instead:** Focus on the 80% case, keep it simple

### ‚ùå Don't: Rewrite from Scratch

**Why:** You'll lose all the testing and validation

**Instead:** Iterative enhancements on solid foundation

### ‚ùå Don't: Add Features Because They Sound Cool

**Why:** They'll never get used

**Instead:** Add features that solve real problems you've experienced

---

## Success Metrics

### After Week 2 (Usage Phase):

**Qualitative:**

- ‚úÖ System saved time vs manual approach?
- ‚úÖ Workflow felt natural?
- ‚úÖ Tasks were accurate and complete?
- ‚úÖ Would use again on next feature?

**Quantitative:**

- Time to create tasks: ADR+Spec ‚Üí Ready tasks
- Accuracy: % of generated tasks that were correct
- Coverage: % of spec requirements captured
- Iterations: How many times did you re-run?

### After Week 4 (Enhancement Phase):

**Impact:**

- Enhancements addressed real pain points?
- Workflow improved measurably?
- Would recommend to others?

### After Week 5 (Share Phase):

**Reach:**

- Package published successfully?
- Documentation clear for newcomers?
- Examples demonstrate value?

---

## The Key Question

**What problem are you going to solve using VTM CLI?**

Not "what should I build next?"

But "what am I going to build WITH this system?"

Answer that, and you'll know exactly what (if anything) to enhance.

---

## Potential Real-World Projects

If you need ideas for what to build using VTM:

### 1. VTM CLI Enhancements

- Use VTM to manage VTM development
- Dog-food your own system
- High value, immediate feedback

### 2. API Service

- Design RESTful API
- Generate tasks from spec
- Implement with TDD
- Perfect for VTM workflow

### 3. CLI Tool

- Another command-line tool
- Similar development pattern
- Good test case for VTM

### 4. Library/Package

- Component library
- Utility package
- npm module
- Clear task boundaries

### 5. Database Migration System

- Well-defined tasks
- Clear dependencies
- Good testing story
- Excellent VTM candidate

**Pick one and use VTM to build it. You'll quickly discover what's missing.**

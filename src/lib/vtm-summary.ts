/**
 * Summary of incomplete tasks with completed capabilities.
 *
 * Represents a token-efficient snapshot of VTM state for passing to AI agents.
 * Includes only incomplete tasks (pending, in-progress, blocked) and a list of
 * completed work capabilities (just task titles). This structure enables agents
 * to understand what work remains and what has been accomplished, without
 * loading the full VTM manifest.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This type is designed for token efficiency:
 * - Only incomplete tasks are included (completed tasks filtered out)
 * - Task details are essential fields only (no extra metadata)
 * - Completed work is summarized as capability titles
 * - Typical size: 70% smaller than full VTM manifest
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const summary: VTMSummary = {
 *   incomplete_tasks: [
 *     {
 *       id: 'TASK-001',
 *       title: 'Setup authentication',
 *       description: 'Implement OAuth2 flow...',
 *       status: 'pending',
 *       estimated_hours: 8,
 *       risk: 'high',
 *       test_strategy: 'TDD',
 *       dependencies: ['TASK-003']

 *   completed_capabilities: [
 *     'Set up project structure',

/**
 * Generates token-efficient summaries of VTM state for AI agents.
 *
 * VTMSummarizer creates lightweight snapshots of VTM manifest content,
 * optimized for passing to AI agents during planning and decision-making.
 * By filtering to incomplete tasks only and summarizing completed work
 * as capabilities, the output is typically 70% smaller than the full VTM.
 *
 * This is essential for token-efficient workflows where you need agent
 * context without the overhead of loading entire task manifests.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Key characteristics:
 * - Only incomplete tasks are included (pending, in-progress, blocked)
 * - Completed tasks are summarized as capability titles only
 * - Dependencies are converted to string IDs for JSON serialization
 * - Typical token reduction: 70% compared to full VTM
 * - Useful for multi-step agent workflows (planning, extraction, etc.)
 *
 * Typical workflow:
 * 1. Create summarizer with path to vtm.json
 * 2. Call `generateSummary()` for typed summary object
 * 3. Pass to AI agent via `generateSummaryJSON()` for JSON string
 * 4. Agent uses summary for context-aware decision making
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create summarizer and generate summary
 * const summarizer = new VTMSummarizer('vtm.json');
 * const summary = await summarizer.generateSummary();
 *
 * console.log('Incomplete tasks:', summary.incomplete_tasks.length);
 * console.log('Completed:', summary.completed_capabilities.length);
 *
 * // Get JSON for agent context
 * const json = summarizer.toJSON(summary);
 * // â†’ Pass json to AI agent for decision-making

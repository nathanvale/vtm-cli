# ADR-001: OAuth2 Authentication Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to implement secure authentication for our multi-tenant SaaS application. The system must support:

- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with enterprise identity providers
- Mobile app authentication
- API authentication for third-party integrations
- Compliance with SOC2 and GDPR requirements

## Decision

We will use OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC) as our authentication protocol.

**Core reasons for this choice:**

1. Industry-standard protocol with widespread adoption
2. Native support in major identity providers (Okta, Auth0, Azure AD)
3. Excellent mobile SDK support
4. Strong security model with token refresh capabilities
5. Built-in support for delegated authorization

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: SAML 2.0

- **Pros:** Mature enterprise standard, XML-based
- **Cons:** Complex implementation, poor mobile support, heavyweight protocol
- **Why rejected:** OAuth2/OIDC provides better developer experience and mobile support

### Alternative 2: Custom JWT-based Authentication

- **Pros:** Full control over implementation, lightweight
- **Cons:** Need to implement all security features ourselves, no SSO integration
- **Why rejected:** Reinventing the wheel, increases security risk

### Alternative 3: Session-based Authentication

- **Pros:** Simple to implement, well-understood
- **Cons:** Doesn't scale well, no mobile support, no API access
- **Why rejected:** Doesn't meet our multi-client requirements

### Alternative 4: API Keys Only

- **Pros:** Very simple for API access
- **Cons:** No user context, no SSO, poor security model
- **Why rejected:** Doesn't support our SSO requirements

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Industry-standard security model
- Easy integration with enterprise identity providers
- Good developer experience with existing libraries
- Mobile app support out of the box
- Can delegate user management to identity provider

**Negative:**

- Additional complexity compared to simple session authentication
- Need to manage token refresh flows
- Requires understanding of OAuth2/OIDC specifications
- Initial setup effort for identity provider integration

**Risks:**

- Token storage security on mobile devices (mitigated by using secure storage APIs)
- Token expiration handling (mitigated by implementing automatic refresh)
- Identity provider downtime (mitigated by implementing fallback mechanisms)

## Implementation Notes

- Use authorization code flow with PKCE for all clients
- Implement token refresh automatically
- Store tokens securely (Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android)
- Use short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) with longer-lived refresh tokens (30 days)
- Implement proper token revocation on logout

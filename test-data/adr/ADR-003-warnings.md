# ADR-003: API Rate Limiting Strategy

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Our API is experiencing abuse from some clients making too many requests. We need to implement rate limiting to protect our infrastructure and ensure fair usage across all clients.

## Decision

We will implement token bucket rate limiting at the API gateway level.

**Reasons:**

1. Prevents API abuse
2. Ensures fair resource distribution
3. Industry standard approach

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Fixed Window Rate Limiting

- Simple to implement
- Prone to burst traffic at window boundaries
- Not chosen due to burst issues

### Alternative 2: No Rate Limiting

- No implementation required
- Leaves API vulnerable
- Not acceptable

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Protected API infrastructure
- Fair usage for all clients
- Better resource planning

**Negative:**

- Some legitimate clients may hit limits
- Need to handle rate limit errors gracefully

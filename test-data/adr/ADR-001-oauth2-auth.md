# ADR-001: OAuth2 Authentication Strategy

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need a secure authentication mechanism for our API.

## Decision

Implement OAuth2 with JWT tokens for stateless authentication.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Session-based authentication** - Traditional but requires server-side state
2. **Basic authentication** - Too simple, not suitable for production
3. **OAuth2 with JWT** - Stateless, scalable, industry standard

## Consequences

### Positive

- Stateless authentication
- Scalable across multiple servers
- Industry-standard approach

### Negative

- Token expiration management required
- More complex than basic auth

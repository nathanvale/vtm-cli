## Generated Files

### 1. Command: `.claude/commands/pm/next.md`

```markdown
---
name: pm:next
description: Get next PM task to work on
namespace: pm
version: 1.0.0
allowed-tools: Bash, Read
argument-hint: [optional-filter] [optional-limit]
---

# PM: Next Task

Get the next task from your PM queue.

## Usage

\`\`\`
/pm:next [filter] [limit]
\`\`\`

## Parameters

- `filter` (optional): Filter by status (pending, in-progress, blocked)
- `limit` (optional): Maximum results (default: 5)

## Examples

\`\`\`bash
/pm:next
/pm:next pending
/pm:next in-progress 10
\`\`\`

## Implementation

This is a template stub. Customize with:

\`\`\`bash
#!/bin/bash

FILTER="${ARGUMENTS[0]:-all}"
LIMIT="${ARGUMENTS[1]:-5}"

# TODO: Implement fetching next task
# Connect to your PM system (Notion, database, etc.)

echo "Getting next $LIMIT PM tasks (filter: $FILTER)"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ’¡ Customize this command:"
echo "1. Connect to your PM system"
echo "2. Implement filtering logic"
echo "3. Add status indicators"
\`\`\`

## Next Steps

1. Replace the bash stub with your implementation
2. Connect to your PM system via MCP (/pm:notion)
3. Test: \`/pm:next\`
```

### 2. Skill: `.claude/skills/pm-expert/SKILL.md`

  - Needs task context before starting work
  - Reviewing tasks

trigger_phrases:
  - "what should I work on"
  - "next task"
  - "pm status"
  - "show my tasks"

# PM Expert Skill

## What This Skill Does

Helps you manage your PM workflow with smart command suggestions.

## Available Commands

- \`/pm:next\` - Get next task to work on
- \`/pm:context\` - Get context for current task
- \`/pm:list\` - List all tasks

## When Claude Uses This

When you mention things like:
- "What should I work on?" â†’ Suggests \`/pm:next\`
- "Show me my tasks" â†’ Suggests \`/pm:list\`
- "I need context" â†’ Suggests \`/pm:context\`

## Best Practices

1. **Before starting work**: Run \`/pm:next\`
2. **Understand scope**: Run \`/pm:context\` to see dependencies
3. **Track progress**: Run \`/pm:review\` regularly
```

### 6. Plugin README: `.claude/plugins/pm-automation/README.md`

```markdown
# PM Automation Plugin

Version: 1.0.0
Namespace: /pm

Complete PM domain plugin with commands, auto-discovery, and Notion integration.

## Quick Start

Already installed? Use immediately:

\`\`\`bash
/pm:next              # Get next task
/pm:context TASK-123  # Get details
/pm:list              # See all tasks
\`\`\`

## Setup

### 1. Get Notion Credentials

1. Go to: https://developers.notion.com/
2. Create integration and get API key
3. Add to database: https://api.notion.com/v1/databases/YOUR-ID

### 2. Set Environment Variables

\`\`\`bash
export PM_NOTION_API_KEY="secret_abc123..."
export PM_NOTION_DATABASE_ID="abc123def456"
\`\`\`

### 3. Test Connection

\`\`\`bash
/pm:test-connection
# Should output: âœ“ Connected to Notion
\`\`\`

## Features

âœ… Get next task to work on
âœ… Auto-discovery skill
âœ… Notion integration
âœ… Pre-commit validation
âœ… Team sharing

## Examples

### Get Your Next Task

\`\`\`bash
You: "What should I work on?"
Claude: /pm:next
# â†’ Shows: TASK-123: Implement feature
\`\`\`

### Ensure Commits Link to Tasks

\`\`\`bash
git commit -m "TASK-123: Your work"  # âœ“ Succeeds

git commit -m "Random fix"           # âœ— Fails
# Error: Commit must reference a task ID
\`\`\`

## Customization

### Change Trigger Phrases

Edit \`.claude/skills/pm-expert/SKILL.md\`:

\`\`\`yaml
trigger_phrases:
  - "what should I work on"
  - "next item"
  - "show my queue"
\`\`\`

### Add More Commands

Copy a command file and customize:

\`\`\`bash
cp .claude/commands/pm/next.md .claude/commands/pm/review.md
# Edit review.md with new logic
\`\`\`

## Troubleshooting

### Commands not suggesting?

Make sure trigger phrases match your vocabulary.

### Connection errors?

\`\`\`bash
# Check credentials
echo $PM_NOTION_API_KEY

# Test connection
/pm:test-connection
\`\`\`

## Next Steps

1. Customize trigger phrases
2. Test each command
3. Share with team
4. Add more commands as needed
```

## Registry After Scaffolding

When running `/registry:scan`, it discovers:

```
Components Found: 5

Commands (3):
  â€¢ /pm:next      - Get next PM task [ready]
  â€¢ /pm:context   - Get task context [ready]
  â€¢ /pm:list      - List all tasks [ready]

Skills (1):
  â€¢ pm-expert     - PM domain expert [ready]
    Triggers: "what should I work on", "next task", "pm status", "show my tasks"

MCP Servers (1):
  â€¢ pm-notion     - Notion integration [needs_config]
    Missing: PM_NOTION_API_KEY, PM_NOTION_DATABASE_ID

Hooks (1):
  â€¢ pre-commit    - PM task validation [active]

Plugins (1):
  â€¢ pm-automation - Complete PM domain [v1.0.0]

Relationships:
  pm:next â†’ depends on pm-notion (MCP)
  pm:context â†’ depends on pm-notion (MCP)
  pm:list â†’ depends on pm-notion (MCP)
  pm-expert (Skill) â†’ enables /pm:next, /pm:context, /pm:list
```

## User Workflow After Generation

```
1. User runs: /design:domain pm
   â†’ Answers 5 questions
   â†’ Design saved to .claude/designs/pm.json

2. User runs: /scaffold:domain pm
   â†’ Files generated
   â†’ Summary shown
   â†’ Ready to customize

3. User customizes:
   â†’ Edit commands with real implementation
   â†’ Set environment variables
   â†’ Test each command

4. User tests:
   â†’ /pm:next
   â†’ /pm:context TASK-001
   â†’ /pm:list

5. User verifies:
   â†’ /registry:scan pm
   â†’ Sees all components registered

6. User shares:
   â†’ /share:plugin pm-automation
   â†’ Team members can use

7. Auto-discovery works:
   â†’ User: "What should I work on?"
   â†’ Claude: /pm:next
   â†’ Claude runs command and shows result
```

## Key Observations

1. **Placeholders Replaced:** All {placeholders} are replaced with actual values
2. **Frontmatter Complete:** YAML frontmatter includes all required fields
3. **Customization Comments:** Clear guidance on what to modify
4. **Examples Included:** Multiple implementation patterns shown
5. **Cross-References:** Files link to each other appropriately
6. **Ready to Use:** Can test commands immediately after setup
7. **Team Ready:** plugin.yaml configured for team sharing

This is what a scaffolded domain looks like!

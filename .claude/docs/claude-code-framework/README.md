## üìñ How to Use This Framework

### Best Practice 1: Reference the Prompt

When asking Claude Code questions, include the expert prompt:

```
<paste claude-code-expert-prompt.md>

I want to [build/share/improve] [workflow]. What's the best approach?
```

### Best Practice 2: Use Templates

Don't start from scratch. Copy templates from implementation-guide.md and
modify.

### Best Practice 3: Follow Patterns

When in doubt, reference what Jeremy Longshore does (234+ plugins are real
implementations).

### Best Practice 4: Check Decision Trees

Before building, use visual-reference-guide.md decision tree to understand
architecture.

### Best Practice 5: Use Conversation Templates

Don't write novel prompts. Use templates from using-the-prompt-guide.md.

command) and add as needed. Use decision tree in visual-reference-guide.md.

**Q: Where do I put my files?** A: Follow .claude/ structure in
claude-code-expert-prompt.md. Copy Template 2 from implementation-guide.md.

**Q: How do I know if my architecture is good?** A: Compare against Jeremy
Longshore's plugins or use checklist in visual-reference-guide.md.

**Q: When should I make it a plugin?** A: When your team needs it or you want to
share. See evolution path in visual-reference-guide.md.

**Q: What if I'm stuck?** A: (1) Check visual-reference-guide.md decision tree,
(2) Review matching template in implementation-guide.md, (3) Use conversation
template from using-the-prompt-guide.md with expert prompt.

**Q: Can I really publish and share these?** A: Yes! See Team Standardization
pattern in implementation-guide.md and Leon van Zyl's distribution workflow.

## üéØ The Bottom Line

This system answers the question:

**"How do successful Claude Code developers build and share intelligent,
scalable workflows?"**

By studying real patterns (Jeremy Longshore's 234+ plugins), learning best
practices (Kenny Liao's skills guide), understanding distribution (Leon van
Zyl's workflow), and organizing coherently (.claude/ structure), you can build
like the professionals.

Everything here is tested, proven, and ready to use.

**Start with SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md next.**

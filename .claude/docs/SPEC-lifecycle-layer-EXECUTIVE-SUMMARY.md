# Lifecycle Layer (Layer 2) - Executive Summary

**Status:** Complete and Ready for Implementation  
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Specification Files:** 2,571 lines (main) + 308 lines (quick ref)

---

## What You're Getting

A **comprehensive specification for Layer 2 (Lifecycle Operations)** of the Composable Claude Code Engineering System. This layer transforms static components into living, evolving systems.

**7 fully specified commands:**
1. `/test:command` - Validate components work
2. `/test:integration` - Validate interactions
3. `/evolve:add-skill` - Add auto-discovery
4. `/evolve:to-plugin` - Package for sharing
5. `/evolve:split` - Break into focused parts
6. `/evolve:remove-skill` - Remove auto-discovery
7. `/evolve:rollback` - Undo operations

---

## Key Features

### Testing (Validation)
- **4 test types** for individual components (syntax, execution, dependencies, errors)
- **5 integration scenarios** for component interactions (basic, data, error, performance, concurrent)
- **Coverage metrics** and clear pass/fail criteria
- **Detailed reports** with recommendations

### Evolution (Safe Improvement)
- **All operations reversible** with `/evolve:rollback`
- **Impact analysis** before changes
- **Backup creation** for safety
- **Version history** preserved
- **No breaking changes** - system always works

### Composability
- **Natural progression:** Command → Skilled → Plugin
- **Each step tested** before moving to next
- **Observable through registry** - always know state
- **Self-extending** - system builds its own capabilities

---

## What This Enables

### For Users
- Test a command in <1 minute
- Create skilled command in <2 minutes
- Package plugin in <3 minutes
- **Full lifecycle:** idea → design → scaffold → test → skill → plugin → share in <20 minutes

### For Teams
- Package domains as reusable plugins
- Share components with team members
- Track quality and evolution
- Safe, reversible changes

### For the System
- Self-extends (can build its own testing capability)
- Fully observable (registry shows everything)
- Composable (each layer works independently)
- Scalable (grows from simple to complex)

---

- 300+ lines per command
- Process flows with 6-7 steps each
- 15+ realistic user interaction examples
- 20+ data format examples

### Well-Structured

## How It Works (The Evolution Path)

```
User Idea
    ↓
/design:domain          (Layer 1: Design)
    ↓
/scaffold:domain        (Layer 1: Generate structure)
    ↓
/test:command           (Layer 2: Validate works)
    ↓
/evolve:add-skill       (Layer 2: Enable auto-discovery)
    ↓
/test:integration       (Layer 2: Validate together)
    ↓
/evolve:to-plugin       (Layer 2: Package for sharing)
    ↓
Share with Team
```

Each step:
- **Validated** (tests pass before moving on)
- **Reversible** (can undo with `/evolve:rollback`)
- **Observable** (registry tracks progress)
- **Safe** (no breaking changes)

---

## Integration with Layer 1

Layer 2 builds directly on the Minimum Composable Core:
- Uses `/registry:scan` to find components
- Uses design specs from `/design:domain`
- Uses scaffolded structure from `/scaffold:domain`
- Extends components with testing and evolution capabilities

## Why This Matters

The **Lifecycle Layer** is what makes the Composable Claude Code System practical:

1. **Testing** ensures components work before sharing
2. **Evolution** allows safe improvement of components
3. **Packaging** enables distribution and reuse
4. **Reversibility** means you can always undo changes
5. **Observable** means you always understand your system

Result: **Users can build, test, improve, and share Claude Code components with confidence.**

---

## Ready to Implement

This specification is complete enough to:

✅ Implement all 7 commands without additional design  
✅ Verify implementation against clear success criteria  
✅ Integrate seamlessly with Layer 1  
✅ Demonstrate self-extension capability  
✅ Enable Layer 3 (Intelligence) development  

**No additional design work needed. Can begin immediately.**

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | What | Duration |
|-------|------|----------|
| 2a | Testing commands (/test:*) | 2 weeks |
| 2b | Evolution commands (/evolve:*) | 2 weeks |
| 2c | Self-extension verification | 2 weeks |
| 2d | Documentation and examples | 1 week |

## Questions to Consider

- **How will you test components?** → See `/test:command` specification
- **How will you validate interactions?** → See `/test:integration` specification
- **How will you add auto-discovery?** → See `/evolve:add-skill` specification
- **How will you package for sharing?** → See `/evolve:to-plugin` specification
- **How will you fix mistakes?** → See `/evolve:rollback` specification
- **Can you undo changes?** → Yes, all operations reversible

## Key Innovation: Safe Evolution

Most systems make breaking changes. Not this one.

When you:
- Add a skill: Command still works manually
- Split a component: Original still invokable
- Package a plugin: Can repackage without breaking
- Evolve anything: Can always rollback

**Every change is safe and reversible.**

---

## The System Vision

Start simple. Add what you need.

```
Week 1: Design and scaffold a domain
Week 2: Test it works
Week 3: Add auto-discovery
Week 4: Package for team
Week 5+: Evolve and improve safely
```

All using the same 7 commands. All observable. All reversible. All composable.

## Success Looks Like

User journey:
1. Design PM domain → 5 minutes
2. Scaffold structure → Automatic
3. Test commands → 1 minute each
4. Add skills → 2 minutes each
5. Package plugin → 3 minutes
6. Share with team → Send one .zip file

**Total time: ~20 minutes from idea to shared plugin**

That's Composable Claude Code Engineering.
